Compiling: 

In the shell, enter the command "make." This will compile the myshell.c 
file into an executable called myshell. 
To remove executable, enter "make clean."

How to run:
In the shell, enter ./myshell. This will execute the myshell program.

You can run any unix command in the myshell program and can also execute
multiple commands all at once. Separate the commands with a ";"
A white space is required at both sides of the ";"

e.g.: 
Batten_Toledo> /bin/ls -L ; sleep 100 & ; cat Makefile
